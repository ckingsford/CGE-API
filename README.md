To allow for rsNumber lookup when comparing Genomic Locations, go to "genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables" and select these settings: 

-

clade: Mammal

genome: Human

assembly: Feb. 2009 (GRCh37/hg19)

group: Variation

track: All SNPs(138) 

table: snp138

region: genome

output format: selected fields from primary and related tables

output file: snp138.txt

file type returned: plain text

-

note you can download as a gzip and extract the file and name it "snp138.txt"

In the next screen check the boxes next to: chrom, chromStart and name then click get output and the download will begin. 

place snp138.txt in the PDA folder and now rsNumbers can be looked up.
